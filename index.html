  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, I'm Vivian Clevinger, a college student and self-proclaimed nerd. In my free time, I like reading and writing fictional stories, ice-skating, trying new foods, and listening to music. I am also an advocate for mental health awareness, as I
    deal with <a href="https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Schizoaffective-Disorder/Overview">schizoaffective disorder</a>
    , which is a highly stigmatized disorder. The condition is serious, but I don't let it stop me from making the most out of my life. After being diagnosed in February 2022, I received proper
    treatment for my symptoms and once I became stable, I began my front-end development journey in April 2022.
  </p>

    <li>Written communication</li>
